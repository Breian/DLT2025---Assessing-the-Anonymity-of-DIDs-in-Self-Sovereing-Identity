# DLT2025---Assessing-the-Anonymity-of-DIDs-in-Self-Sovereing-Identity
## Abstract
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) represents a paradigm of identity management which resolves issues of current
Identity Management System (IMS) by providing to users full control over their personal data without relying on
third-party providers. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are essential components of SSI as they provide a new type
of identifier enabling to uniquely and globally identify an entity without having to rely on a central authority. In
this paper, we investigate the anonimity of DIDs used in SSI by using different sources of information to assess
if these systems expose sensitive information that can be exploited to infer personal information about users.
We leverage the proposed framework to evaluate the anonymity properties of a real-world DID implementation
based on the Ethereum blockchain, highlighting the systemâ€™s strengths and weaknesses in terms of privacy and
de-anonymization risks.
